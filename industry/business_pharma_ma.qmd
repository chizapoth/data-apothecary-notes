#### Terms

Patent Cliff: When a drug loses exclusivity and faces generic/biosimilar competition.

Pipeline: Drugs in development; valuable assets.

Biotech vs Big Pharma: Biotechs innovate; big pharma commercializes and scales.

Synergy: Cost savings or increased revenue expected post-merger.

Valuation Multiples: P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, and price-to-sales used to judge deal value.


#### Questions to ask

* What does the acquirer want
* What is the target companies values for
* Is the pricing reasonable 


### Strategic rationale: why the deal?

Core motivation behind the acquisition

* **pipeline expansion**: access to new drug candidates, especially in late-stage clinical trials 
* **therapeutic area** strengthening: deepening expertise in key areas (e.g. diabetes, neuroscience)
* patent cliff defense: replace soon-to-expire blockbuster drugs
* technology / platform acquisition
* **geographic expansion**: entering new markets
* synergies: cost savings, R&D integration, manufacturing efficiency


### Deal structure and financial terms

* deal size
* type of deal: all-cash, stock-based, mixed
* premium paid: how much over the target's market value (20-50% common)
* contingent payments: milestone payments
* financing: will the acquirer take on debt, use reserves or issue equity


### Regulatory implications

* FDA/EMA risk: will the acquired products be approved
* pricing / access politics: expect scrutiny over pricing power


### Market and investor reactions

* stock movements
* analyst commentary: is it strategic or desperate?
* shareholder approvals

Strategic patterns

* All but Prometheus focused heavily on **oncology** (esp. biologics or ADCs)
* Big pharma increasingly relies on **biotech innovation** for pipeline sustainability
* Roche-Genentech stands out for preserving autonomy; others leaned toward full absorption
* Earlier-stage deals (Prometheus) = high potential, high uncertainty; later-stage = safer, pricier
